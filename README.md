## Project Overview

For this project, I use use exploratory data analysis of data movies databases to generate insights for a business stakeholder and find at least 3 business ideas.

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### Stakeholder

### Key business recommendations:

1) BUDGET
The planned budget for film should be : 20+ mln USD:

The Majority of films 20-100mln USD
Some part of films films 100+ USD

2) GENRES
The studio should focus on genres: 
- adventure,
- animation,

Films in these genres have higher raiting and the highest box office with the median value 200M +
- Action 
Can be considered as an option for low budget films.
